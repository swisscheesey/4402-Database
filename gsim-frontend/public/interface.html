        <h3>Here are some buttons with which to run SQL queries:</h3>
        <p>Find all products worth 4 dollars or more: </p>
        <p><button type="button">Click Here</button></p>
        <p>Find the brand name for any product with less than 70 in inventory: </p>
        <p><button type="button">Click Here</button></p>
        <p>Find the category for each item in a shelf spoit in the inventory: </p>
        <p><button type="button">Click Here</button></p>
        <h3>Here you can use in-built commands to do certain database updates:</h3>
        <p>Use "INPUT" followed by the relation in which you want to add information and the necessary values in parentheses.</p>
        <p>Ex: INPUT item(26, 'Tortilla Chips', 3.00, 'Telmo', 2, 'shelf spot 6')</p>
        <p>Use "DELETE" followed by the relation in which you want to remove information and the primary key of the entry you wish to remove in parentheses.</p>
        <p>Ex: DELETE category(3)</p>
        <p>Use "UPDATE" followed by the relation in which you wish to update information and the necessary values in parentheses. The program will find the entry with the same primary key and alter its other values to match the values you entered.</p>
        <p>Ex: UPDATE inventory('shed spot 4', 23, 55)</p>
        <p>Possible relations are "item", "inventory", and "category". Please keep in mind that "inventory" and "item" must have the same amount of entries; each item has a unique inventory slot which shares its inventory name. Any category value greater than 6 will also require a new entry added to the "category" to compensate. Removing a category without removing the items within that category can cause the system to have issues later on. There are currently 25 entries in "item"; any new entries should use a product ID of 26 or greater.</p>
